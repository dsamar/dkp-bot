# DKP Discord Bot

Things left to do:
- track current dkp values per member
- add command for editing dkp of a member
- add command to assign dkp to current roster
- decay dkp command
- allow closing a bid (bidend). should determine winner automatically and subtract dkp, while adding dkp to rest of raid.
- separate channel for listing current dkp, only has one message with whole list, member to value.
- allow tracking of attendance? we have a list of all raids in the channel, track rosters of each, mark attendance on dkp sheet.
- add rest of classes to raid signups
- make the raid screen look nicer, show stats of dps/melee/healers?
