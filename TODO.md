## OUTSTANDING ISSUES

- add commands to edit user's attendance numbers?

## OPTIONAL

- make command that lets you give points to on-time members by subtracting it from whole raid?
- add rest of classes to raid signups?
- make the raid screen look nicer, show stats of dps/melee/healers?
- add commands to edit user's attendance numbers?
- optional? add an on-time tracker/number?
- command to end a raid !raidend, removing it from pinned
- allow for rolling to break ties, or just use in-game rolling
- command DEMO to populate a set of demo members to a raid
- command DEMO to award 20 random items to raid, as if members were winning it

## ATTENDANCE TODOS

- adding a member to a raid that already started should increment attendance for the member.
- Having an X on your leaderboard means you either missed the raid or were late. If you were late but are a new member, you will not get an X.
