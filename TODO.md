## OUTSTANDING ISSUES

- command to backup/restore function for leaderboard

- setup should not delete all emojis
- setup needs to have a first run mode, should not wipe DKP.

- command DEMO to populate a set of demo members to a raid
- command DEMO to award 20 random items to raid, as if members were winning it

- command to undo awarding item with !bidend, refunding dkp back to raid. (may be needed if item was assigned by accident)

- when any item is won, check other pending items to update
- bidID dissapears

- add a command to award micro-ammounts for folks that farm and subtract from rest. 

- add item name to message for winning the item

## OPTIONAL

- make command that lets you give points to on-time members by subtracting it from whole raid?
- add rest of classes to raid signups?
- make the raid screen look nicer, show stats of dps/melee/healers?
- add commands to edit user's attendance numbers?
- optional? add an on-time tracker/number?
- command to end a raid !raidend, removing it from pinned
- allow for rolling to break ties, or just use in-game rolling

## ATTENDANCE TODOS

- adding a member to a raid that already started should increment attendance for the member.
- Having an X on your leaderboard means you either missed the raid or were late. If you were late but are a new member, you will not get an X.
